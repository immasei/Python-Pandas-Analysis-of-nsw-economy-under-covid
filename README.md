# How covid impact the economy in Australia, especially in NSW?

## Purpose
COVID-19 officially started from January 2020 and still hasn't ended. It leaves heavy impacts on societies, health and economies. Still, there are people who havenâ€™t been affected by the pandemic and some of them are very subjective. Therefore, we aim to highlight the seriousness of COVID-19 using supporting statistics, to raise awareness of people who travel by public transport, that they should follow the mask guidelines.

In order to find out the economic consequences leaved by COVID-19 in Australia
(NSW), we find 4 data sets, which are about:

1. number of international students in enrolments and commencements

2. transport usage
 
3. (un)employment rate
 
4. number of passengers in and out at 20 airports
   
These data sets are recorded for every month for several years. We expect that in 2020 all data should decrease due to border closure, lockdowns, business difficulties and flight restrictions. Decreases in enrolments, employments, transport usages and flights (travel) will indeed show the impact on the economy.
